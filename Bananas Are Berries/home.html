  <p> Fruits can be divided into two main categories: fleshy or dry. </p>
  <p>Dry fruits are foods not typically thought of as fruit, such as nuts, legumes and coconuts. </p>
  <p>On the other hand, fleshy fruits are the types that are well-known â€” common fruits, such as apples, cherries and bananas. </p>
  <p>Fleshy fruit can be further subdivided into simple fruits, aggregate fruits or multiple fruits. </p>
