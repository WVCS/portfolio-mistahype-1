<p id="About"> 
Spitz are well suited to living in harsh northern climates:
</p>
<ul>
<li> They often have an insulating, waterproof undercoat that is denser than the topcoat to trap warmth </li>
<li> Small ears help to reduce the risk of frostbite </li>
<li> Thick fur that grows on the paws protects the dogs from sharp ice </li>
</ul>
<p>Many spitz breeds, like the Akita and Chow Chow, retain wolf-like characteristics like independence, suspiciousness, and aggression towards unfamiliar humans and other dogs, and they require much training and socialization when they are puppies before they become manageable in an urban environment. </p>
