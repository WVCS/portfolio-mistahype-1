<h1> What are Spitz? </h1>
<p>Spitz (also pluralized spitzes or, borrowing from German, Spitze, or from Dutch, spitsen) are a type of domestic dog characterized by long, thick, and often white fur, and pointed ears and muzzles. The tail often curls over the dog's back or droops. The exact origins of spitz dogs are not known, though most of the spitz seen today originate from the Arctic region or Siberia. The type was described as Canis pomeranus by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revision of Systema Naturae in 1788 (printed in English in 1792). </p>
